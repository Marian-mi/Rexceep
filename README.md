# Rexceep

Yet another regex enigne :p

This project is wholly being operated for educational puporses since I found compilers pretty interesting  

The engine itself consists of few main parts and it's written entirely in C

Why C?
I tought using a procedural language would be more sensual for creating the engine  
It was also a good training ground for me before free falling into the assmebly language  
I just love using simple things to create more complicated matters and having full control of the tool I'm using and C was the barest I could get

### Parser:
Responsible for parsing the regular exporession and creating a AST  
Implemented a LL(1) parser generator to handle the parsing
